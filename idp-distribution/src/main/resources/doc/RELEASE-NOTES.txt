Notes for version 3.0.0-alpha1
===============================
This is the first alpha release of the 3.0 Identity Provider software.

NOTE especially that there is not yet a true installation process, and the
private and secret keys that are included by default are not generated, but
are dummy keys that are checked into subversion and are part of the testing
environment. Using the software for any sensitive purpose is ill advised,
but would require at minimum replacing those keys.
