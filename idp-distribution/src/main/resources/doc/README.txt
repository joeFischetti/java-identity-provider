3.0 Alpha Release Notes 
=======================

This is an alpha release of the 3.0 Identity Provider software.
Refer to https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/ConfigurationGuide
for information on configuration and testing.

This is alpha software; as such, we do not recommend deploying this code in
production. It is a fairly advanced alpha and represents preliminary decisions
on what the final software will look like, but feedback on configuration and
defaults is very valuable at this stage.

Most, though not all, features supported by 2.4.0 are included in this release.
